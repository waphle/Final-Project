          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings! My name is Jeff Zhang. I'm currently
          a sophomore at the American University in Washington, DC, studying computer science.
          I was born in Vancouver, Canada on March 3, 2000, where I lived there till
          I was seven. Since then, my family resides in the town of Lexington, near Boston, MA.
        </span>
        <span>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since I was a child, I've loved drawing; from my childhood heros like
          Batman to my own characters, I drew to express my imagination. Nowadays,
          I mostly just draw for leisure and when I have the time, but when I do,
          I can spend hours upon hours just trying to perfect the little details on
          my work.
        </span>
        <span>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like drawing, I started doing photography at a young age, but it wasn't until
          I was 15 I started taking it seriously. Using my dad's Nikon DSLR camera,
          I took nearly every photograph during family vacations, and when time permitted,
          doing portrait and scenenic photo shoots with my friends or just on my own.
          In the future, I will buy my own camera so that I can still do photography
          when I'm not back home with access to my dad's camera :)
