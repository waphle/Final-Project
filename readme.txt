Web Programming Final Project, Jeff Zhang and Nathaniel Riley

For this project, we created a gaming tutorial website called "Epic Gaming Tutorials." 
We included a home page, where users can read about the website's history, tutorials for different games, 
testimonies about the page, sign up as a user, and contact the owners of the website. We created several HTML files,
each for a different page the user can visit, which are linked together via JavaScript. In the "user sign-in/up" page, 
we used [REDACTED].
