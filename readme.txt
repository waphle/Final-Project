Web Programming Final Project, Jeff Zhang and Nathaniel Riley

For this project, we created a gaming tutorial website called "Epic Gaming Tutorials." 
We included a home page, where users can read about the website's history, tutorials for different games, 
testimonies about the page, sign up as a user, and contact the owners of the website. We created several HTML files,
each for a different page the user can visit, which are linked together via JavaScript. Included features are a user
sign-in/up page, hyperlinks to external websites, and testimonials. 

For the tutorial page, we cited Wikipedia for the games' descriptions.
PONG: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong
DOOM Eternal: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Eternal
The Witcher 3: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt
