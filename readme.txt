For this project, we created a gaming tutorial website called "Epic Gaming Tutorials." 
We included a home page, where users can read about the website's history, tutorials for different games, 
testimonies about the page, and sign up as a user. We created several PHP files,
each for a different page the user can visit, which are linked together via JavaScript. Included features are a user
sign-in/up page, hyperlinks to external websites, and testimonials. 

The UI design was based on Jeff's Creative Project website, which was later heavily changed to better fit the needs
of our new website. We wanted to make a clear, simplistic interface that wasn't "too out there" and wanted it to have an 
appealing aesthetic. 

For the tutorial page, we cited Wikipedia for the games' descriptions.
PONG: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong
DOOM Eternal: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Eternal
The Witcher 3: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt
TF2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2

For testimonials, we used a combination of both original text and copypasta found online 
(Reddit.com, https://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/_latin). 
Images used for the testimonials belong to their original creators.
